      I have so many kinds of fish in my aquarium.
      I am level 28 "great fisher".
      I have my own boat.
      I have a pet named Hershey.
      I can invite other players to my aquarium.</p>

      <p>Adventures that I do in the game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raygan Quests</li>
        <li>Eruption Island</li>
        <li>Shadow Island</li>
      </ul>

          I have to do Ragan's quests befor time runs out.
          He will give me some gems if I complete the quest.
          His place is right across Petrica's Pets.
          He needs different types of fish.
          Tip: Don't get the quest that  has the fish that you don't know instead, get the ones that you know.</p>
